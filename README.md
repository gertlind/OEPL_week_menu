Place the menu.json on a webserver I did put on the OEPL access point in the folder "current.
Just to mention, I tried to put the json file in the www and also the root folder ocf the AP. Neither of those worked for me.

Create the rest sensor in Home Assistant. Change ip address and folder to where you did put it.
